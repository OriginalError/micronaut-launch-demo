# Micronaut Launch Demo

## Why Does This Exist?
For a few reasons! Josh wanted to try out micronaut launch, the jupiter testing framework and getting Java set up on his home PC. 

The other (potentially main) purpose was creating a demo for `Creating Microservices with Micronaut` presentation.

Random aside - I came into Micronaut a skeptic. I've used several JAVA frameworks that either didn't meet my standard of testability, speed, or ease-of-use. 

## Local Commands

- Run Tests - `./mvnw test`
- Run Compile - `./mvnw compile`
